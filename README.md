#### Grassland Management Under Climate Change in the Thunder Basin Grassland Region

This project will display a habitat suitability model for Sorghastrum nutans, which are a grass native to North America, that has moved northward in the past 5 decades. The changing of grasslands puts both biodiversity and human well-being in danger, as restoration is very difficult especially if access to native species seeds are unavailable. The model will be based on combining multiple data layers related to soil type, topography, and climate with a focus on the Thunder Basin National Grasslands. The result will show areas with ideal conditions for Sorghastrum nutans to survive in.

## How to run the code

Describe how to run the code. 

## Usage

This project will be useful to those who are trying to restore grasslands into their natural habitat, to do so though they must find ideal areas for the grasses to thrive in which due to climate change are now different than they used to be. Thus, why it is important to map using a habitat suitability model.
